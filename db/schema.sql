-- Powerlifting Coach — Supabase Postgres schema.
--
-- Run this ONCE in your Supabase project: Dashboard → SQL Editor → New query →
-- paste → Run. It mirrors the old better-sqlite3 schema. `created_at` columns
-- are millisecond epoch timestamps (BIGINT); `date` columns are 'YYYY-MM-DD'
-- text. Authentication is Clerk (see src/lib/auth.ts); all data access is
-- server-side and gated in the app by athlete_id, so RLS is intentionally left
-- off.
