          For most of your data, Liftly is the “controller” within the meaning of Article 4(7) of the
          EU General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the “GDPR”) and the equivalent
          “business” under the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights
          Act (Cal. Civ. Code §1798.100 et seq., the “CCPA/CPRA”). We decide how and why your data is
          used. If you use Liftly through a coach who manages your account, that coach acts as an
          independent controller of the training data they review, and their own privacy practices govern
          that review.
